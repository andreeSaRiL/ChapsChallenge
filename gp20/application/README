The application module provides a Graphical User Interface through which the player can see the maze and interact with
it through the following keystrokes:

CTRL-X  - exit the game, the current game state will be lost, the next time the game is started, it will resume from
the last unfinished level
CTRL-S  - exit the game, saves the game state, game will resume next time the application will be started
CTRL-R  - resume a saved game
CTRL-P  - start a new game at the last unfinished level
CTRL-1 - start a new game at level 1
SPACE - pause the game and display a “game is paused” dialog
ESC - close the “game is paused” dialog and resume the game
UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT ARROWS -- move Chap within the maze

The application window should display the time left to play, the current level, keys collected, and the number of
treasures that still need to be collected.  It should also offer buttons and menu items to pause and exit the game,
to save the game state and to resume a saved game, and to display a help page with game rules.

Note that the actual drawing of the maze is not the responsibility of the application module, but of the
rendering module.

This module also manages a countdown -- each level has a maximum time associated with it (such as 1 min), and the
once the countdown reaches zero, the game terminates with a group dialog informing the user, and resetting the game
to replay the level.

The application package must include an executable class nz.ac.vuw.ecs.swen225.gp20.application.Main which starts the
game.

Graphical user interfaces are notoriously difficult to test, so no unit tests are expected for this package.
Testing is to be done manually.
